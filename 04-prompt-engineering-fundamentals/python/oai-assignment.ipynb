    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "\n",
      "### Ingredients:\n",
      "**For the Cake:**\n",
      "- 1 and 3/4 cups (220g) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 and 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar\n",
      "- 3/4 cup (75g) unsweetened cocoa powder\n",
      "- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 large eggs, room temperature\n",
      "- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk, room temperature\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1 cup (240ml) boiling water\n",
      "\n",
      "**For the Frosting:**\n",
      "- 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, room temperature\n",
      "- 3 and 1/2 cups (440g) powdered sugar\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (50g) unsweetened cocoa powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream\n",
      "\n",
      "### Directions:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Make the Cake:\n",
      "1. **Preheat your oven** to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans, or line them with parchment paper circles.\n",
      "2. **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until well combined.\n",
      "3. **Add the wet ingredients**: Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed with a hand or stand mixer until well combined.\n",
      "4. **Incorporate boiling water**: Reduce speed to low and carefully add the boiling water to the batter. Beat until fully combined. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.\n",
      "5. **Bake**: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n",
      "6. **Cool**: Remove cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, remove from pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Make the Frosting:\n",
      "1. **Beat the butter**: In a large bowl, beat the room temperature butter on high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes.\n",
      "2. **Add dry ingredients**: Gradually add powdered sugar and cocoa powder, beating on low speed until combined and smooth.\n",
      "3. **Add vanilla and cream**: Add salt, vanilla extract, and heavy cream. Beat on high speed for about 3 minutes, until frosting is light and fluffy. Add more cream if necessary to reach your desired consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Assemble the Cake:\n",
      "1. **Level the cakes**: If necessary, level the tops of the cakes with a serrated knife to create an even surface.\n",
      "2. **Frost the cake**: Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread frosting evenly on top. Add the second layer and cover the entire cake with the remaining frosting.\n",
      "3. **Decorate**: Decorate as desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips:\n",
      "- Ensure ingredients like eggs and milk are at room temperature before you start.\n",
      "- You can add coffee instead of boiling water to enhance the chocolate flavor.\n",
      "- For extra flair, consider decorating the cake with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or berries.\n",
